## Overview & Vision

### The Problem

Most arithmetic quiz applications are **disposable** — you answer questions, see a score, close the app, and remember nothing. They offer no insight into what went wrong, no reason to return tomorrow, and no sense of progress over time. For children in particular, punitive grading language actively discourages continued use.

### The Solution

Atelier Arithmetic is positioned not as a quiz app, but as a **personal math training companion**. It:

- Tells children **exactly** which questions they got wrong and what the correct answers were via a scrollable review screen.
- Tracks **how fast** they answered each question, encouraging computational fluency.
- **Saves every session** to a relational SQLite database indexed by user profile for long-term analytics.
- Uses **encouraging, growth-mindset language** in every piece of feedback, narrated by Archie the Owl.
- Onboards every new user with a **19-step interactive guided tour** so they immediately feel confident using the full feature set.
- Motivates daily return through **streaks, achievements, and a star economy** that lets children customize Archie.

## Quiz Categories & Question Engine

All 10 categories use the `QuestionGenerator` service to generate **fully randomized, non-repeating questions** seeded per session. Each difficulty level meaningfully changes operand ranges and structural complexity:

### Core Categories (Phase 1)

| Category | Easy | Medium | Hard |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Addition** | 2 operands (10–99) | 3 operands (100–999) | 4 operands (1000–9999) |
| **Difference** | 2 operands, guaranteed positive | 3 operands | 4 operands |
| **Multiplication** | 2 factors (2–12 × 2–12) | 2 larger factors | 3 factors |
| **Division** | Perfect divisors up to 10 | Larger perfect quotients | Multi-step exact division |
| **Mixed** | Randomly picks one of the 4 core types per question | ← | ← |
| **Special** | BODMAS bracket expressions with 1 inner op | Nested expressions | 3-term compound brackets |

### Advanced Categories (Phase 5)

| Category | Easy | Medium | Hard |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Fractions** | Simple fractional parts of integers | Mixed number conversions, ratios | Percentage queries, complex fraction multiplication |
| **Patterns** | Linear progressions (±step) | Alternating steps, progressive increments | Geometric sequences, Fibonacci-like, polynomial `n*(n+1)` |
| **Algebra** | Single-step `x + B = C` | Two-step `Ax + B = C`, `(x+B)/A = C` | Double-sided equations, simultaneous systems |
| **Measurement** | Metric conversions (m→cm, L→mL) | Time calculations, rectangular area/perimeter | Box volumes, multi-unit complex word problems |

### Daily Challenge Mode
The Home Screen's **Daily Quest Tracker** launches a date-seeded 10-question daily challenge. The same questions are generated for all users on the same day (deterministic seed), and completion awards **+8 bonus stars**. Completion state resets each calendar day.

---

## Project Architecture

The application follows a strict **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern, enhanced with a **Service layer** and a **Config/Utility** layer. All inter-panel navigation is mediated through the `QuizNavigator` interface, ensuring panels remain loosely coupled and independently testable.

### Key Design Principles
- **QuizNavigator interface**: All panels depend only on this interface — never on `QuizFrame` directly — making each panel independently portable.
- **Single panel instances**: All 11 panels are created once in `QuizFrame` and reused via `CardLayout`, minimizing memory overhead and enabling smooth transitions.
- **Service-Panel separation**: No panel contains business logic. All computation (scoring, grading, reward calculation, hint generation, etc.) lives in dedicated service classes.
- **Encrypted persistence**: Both `config.properties` and all sensitive SQLite columns are encrypted at rest via AES-128.

## Installation & Running

### 📦 End-User Installation (Windows Native — No Java Required)

Atelier Arithmetic ships as a fully self-contained Windows application bundled with a stripped custom Java runtime:

1. Download `AtelierArithmetic-1.0.0.msi` (or extract `AtelierArithmetic-v1.0.0-Portable.zip`).
2. Run the installer. It will:
   - Install the application and a bundled ~35MB custom JRE (no system Java needed).
   - Create **Desktop** and **Start Menu** shortcuts.
   - Register a clean uninstaller in **Add/Remove Programs**.
3. Launch from the desktop shortcut. No terminal or command line required.

**Silent Installation (classrooms/bulk deployment):**
```cmd
msiexec /i AtelierArithmetic-1.0.0.msi /qn /norestart
```

### 💻 Developer Quick Launch

Requires **JDK 17+** installed and on `PATH`. Clone or download the repository and run:

```cmd
run.bat
```

This compiles all source files with the SQLite classpath, copies logo resources to the binary output, and launches the app.

### 🛠️ Rebuild Native Installer

Requires JDK 21 and [WiX Toolset v3.11+](https://wixtoolset.org/) on `PATH`:

```powershell
powershell -File package.ps1
```

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed packaging, code signing, and distribution instructions.

**Shop mechanics:**
- **Purchase** via a confirmation dialog — balance is checked before deducting.
- **Equip** any owned item — it appears in Archie's greeting tagline on the Home Screen.
- **Unequip** to return Archie to his default appearance.
- Guard against duplicate purchases — the Buy button is permanently replaced with Equip once an item is owned.
- The **Home Screen Shop Card** shows the live balance and equipped item name at a glance.

## Analytics & Intelligence Layer

### Smart Practice Mode
Scans all session history to identify the weakest category and lowest accuracy difficulty. Displays a personalized recommendation card. The `Launch Practice` button immediately starts a targeted 10-question session at that exact category/difficulty combination.

### Adaptive Difficulty Engine
During an active quiz session, `AdaptiveDifficultyEngine` evaluates every submitted answer:
- **Upgrade suggestion**: 5 consecutive perfect answers → banner suggests stepping up.
- **Downgrade suggestion**: 3 consecutive wrong answers → banner suggests stepping down.
- A 5-question cooldown suppresses repeated suggestions to avoid interrupting flow.

### Analytics Service
`AnalyticsService` computes:
- Overall accuracy percentage across all sessions
- Per-category average accuracy (used for radar chart)
- Accuracy trend data for the Bezier line chart (last 20 sessions)
- Current and longest practice streaks (date-aware)
- Weakest and strongest category identification

---

## Data Persistence & SQLite Architecture

All session data is stored in an embedded SQLite database at `~/.atelier-arithmetic/atelier_arithmetic.db`.

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│           sessions           │
├──────────────────────────────┤
│ id          INTEGER PK AUTO  │◄──────────────┐
│ profile_name  TEXT (encrypted)│               │
│ timestamp     TEXT           │               │ ON DELETE
│ category      TEXT (encrypted)│               │ CASCADE
│ difficulty    TEXT (encrypted)│               │
│ total_questions  INTEGER     │               │
│ correct_answers  INTEGER     │               │
│ percentage    REAL           │               │
│ grade         TEXT (encrypted)│               │
│ duration_ms   INTEGER        │               │
└──────────────────────────────┘               │
                                               │
┌──────────────────────────────┐               │
│       session_questions      │               │
├──────────────────────────────┤               │
│ id          INTEGER PK AUTO  │               │
│ session_id  INTEGER FK ───────────────────────┘
│ expression  TEXT (encrypted) │
│ correct_answer  INTEGER      │
│ user_answer     INTEGER      │
│ correct     INTEGER (0/1)    │
│ time_ms     INTEGER          │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key guarantees:**
- **ACID Transactions**: Session and all its question records are written atomically. A failure rolls back everything.
- **Cascading Deletes**: Clearing history purges both tables cleanly via `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
- **Profile Isolation**: All rows include an encrypted `profile_name` column — a single database supports unlimited profiles.
- **Foreign Key Enforcement**: `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` is executed on every connection.

**User preferences** are stored in `~/.atelier-arithmetic/config.properties`, including:
- Profile list and active profile
- Star balance (per-profile)
- Unlocked and equipped shop items (per-profile)
- Sound enabled/volume, dark mode, font scale
- Tour completion flag, last daily challenge date

## 🔐 Security, Child Safety & Privacy (COPPA / GDPR-K)

Atelier Arithmetic implements strict **privacy-by-design** principles:

### Zero Network Activity
The application makes **zero external network requests**. All data is stored strictly offline on the child's machine. There are no analytics trackers, no cloud syncs, and no third-party SDKs.

### AES-128 Encryption at Rest

The `CryptoHelper` class provides AES-128/ECB/PKCS5Padding encryption using a machine-unique key derived from:
```
SHA-256(user.name + os.name + user.home) → first 16 bytes → AES key
```

This binds encrypted data to the specific machine, making copied database files non-readable on other systems.

**What is encrypted:**
- Entire `config.properties` file (serialized as plaintext, then encrypted as Base64)
- `profile_name`, `category`, `difficulty`, `grade` columns in the `sessions` table
- `expression` column in the `session_questions` table

**Graceful fallback:** If decryption fails (e.g., legacy plain-text config), the raw value is used without crashing.

### COPPA-Aware Profile Management
- **Privacy directive** shown at profile creation: *"To protect child safety, please do not use your real first or last name!"*
- **🎭 Spark Mascot Name generator** creates fun adjective-animal pseudonyms (e.g., *"Joyful Penguin"*, *"Clever Fox"*) at the click of a button
- Profile name constraints: no spaces, no special characters, max 15 characters

### Data Minimization
The application collects only what is required for its educational function:
- Quiz performance records (encrypted)
- User preferences (encrypted)
- No photos, audio recordings, geolocation, or biometrics

---

## 🛡️ Parental Gate System

All sensitive settings and data management controls are protected by a **word-based math challenge dialog** to prevent children from accidentally accessing or modifying them.

### Protected Areas

| Feature | Gate Trigger |
|---|---|
| 📊 Analytics Dashboard | On entry from Home Screen |
| 🛠️ Custom Quiz Builder | On launch from Home Screen |
| 🗑 Reset History | On click in Analytics Dashboard |
| 🔊 Sound Settings Popup | On click from top bar |

### Challenge Format

A randomly generated multiplication problem presented entirely in English words:

> *"This screen is for parents or teachers only.*
> *Please solve this math puzzle to proceed:*
> ★ What is **eight** times **seven**? ★"

- Factors are randomly selected between 3 and 12 on each invocation.
- Access is granted only upon entering the exact correct numeric answer.
- Clicking **Cancel** or entering a wrong answer silently denies access.

---

## 🔉 Immersive Audio System

`SoundService` generates all audio **programmatically at runtime** using `javax.sound.sampled` — no audio files are bundled. This achieves zero-dependency audio with full volume control.

### Sound Events

| Event | Sound |
|---|---|
| App launch | Rising warm C-major chord chime |
| Button hover | Quiet high-frequency tick |
| Button click | Brief clean pop |
| Category selected | Bright A5 bell chime |
| Quiz start | Energetic 4-note rising arpeggio |
| Correct answer | C5 → E5 → G5 major triad arpeggio |
| Wrong answer | Descending soft buzz slide |
| Achievement unlocked | Sparkling double high-bell arpeggio |
| Streak milestone | Uplifting quick slide up |
| Timer tick | Quiet wooden clock tick |
| Navigation transition | Quick slide-up chime |

### Global Instrumentation

`AppTheme.scaleComponentFont()` recursively walks the entire Swing component tree and attaches hover and click `MouseListener` instances to every `JButton`. This means **all buttons across all panels** automatically produce audio feedback with zero per-button wiring.

### Sound Settings
A parental-gate-protected popup provides:
- **Master mute toggle**
- **Volume slider** (0–100%) with live preview tone on change

---

## 🚨 Global Exception Handling & Logging

The application is designed to **never freeze or crash silently**.

```java
Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler((thread, throwable) -> {
    // 1. Write full stack trace to ~/.atelier-arithmetic/logs/error.log
    // 2. Show friendly child-facing dialog via SwingUtilities.invokeLater()
});
```

- **Scope**: Catches all uncaught exceptions on every thread, including the Swing EDT.
- **Disk Logging**: Stack trace, thread name, and timestamp are appended to `error.log`.
- **User Dialog**: A friendly popup lets children know to restart, preventing silent hangs:
  > *"Oops! Archie the Owl encountered a tiny calculation hiccup. We have saved a report. You can restart or continue playing!"*

## 📦 Windows Packaging & Distribution

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for the full guide. Summary:

### `package.ps1` — Automated Build Pipeline

1. **Verify tools** — checks `JAVA_HOME`, locates `jlink`, `jpackage`, and WiX
2. **Compile** — `javac` with the SQLite classpath
3. **Icon conversion** — compiles and runs `IcoConverter.java` to translate `logo.png` → `logo.ico`
4. **Custom JRE (`jlink`)** — links a stripped ~35MB runtime from only required modules:
   `java.base, java.desktop, java.sql, java.xml, java.naming, jdk.charsets`
5. **Native launcher (`jpackage`)** — bundles the JRE + JAR into `dist/AtelierArithmetic/AtelierArithmetic.exe`
6. **MSI Installer** (if WiX present) — produces `dist/AtelierArithmetic-1.0.0.msi` with:
   - Start Menu + Desktop shortcuts
   - Directory chooser
   - Automatic uninstaller hook
   - Upgrade UUID `71a2e7c3-3882-4df4-94fa-7e9b422a59cc` for clean version upgrades
7. **Portable ZIP fallback** (if WiX absent) — `dist/AtelierArithmetic-v1.0.0-Portable.zip`

### `sign.ps1` — EV Code Signing Pipeline

- Dynamically locates `signtool.exe` from Windows SDK paths
- Supports EV Hardware USB Tokens (Smart Card / YubiKey) and `.pfx` file signing
- Signs with SHA-256, applies a DigiCert RFC 3161 timestamp
- Runs `signtool verify /pa` to confirm a valid signature after signing

---

## Design Philosophy

1. **Growth Mindset First** — No punitive text or red-screen panic at any score tier. Every grade, including D, carries an encouraging message. Archie's feedback adapts to the child's accuracy without shaming.

2. **Parent & Teacher Empowerment** — The Quiz Builder and Analytics Dashboard give adults visibility and control. The Parental Gate ensures children cannot accidentally modify administrative settings.

3. **Vibrant, Premium Aesthetics** — Warm editorial color palette (`#FAF9F6` parchment, `#B8966E` bronze gold), custom rounded card panels with shadow margins, serif display headings, and a full Dark Mode using a rich graphite-charcoal palette (`#18181C`).

4. **Accessible by Design** — Font scaling at 100%/125%/150% accommodates different visual needs. Emoji labels are paired with `Segoe UI Emoji` font tags in HTML labels to guarantee correct rendering on Windows.

5. **Zero Friction Engagement** — Stars, streaks, and daily challenges create natural return loops without addiction mechanics. All rewards are balanced for educational motivation, not compulsive engagement.

## Technical Highlights

### Base64-Embedded Report Export
The HTML report exporter reads `logo.png` at runtime, converts it to a Base64 data URI, and writes it inline into the exported HTML file. Reports are self-contained — they display the branding correctly when shared across machines with no broken image links.

### Seeded Daily Challenge
`QuestionGenerator.generateSeeded(difficulty, category, dateSeed, questionIndex)` accepts a `long` date seed derived from today's date. This guarantees that all children using the app on the same day get the exact same set of daily challenge questions, making the daily challenge shareable and comparable.

### Component-Level Sound Instrumentation
`AppTheme.scaleComponentFont()` uses the `JComponent` client-property API to mark each button as `soundAttached` before adding listeners, preventing duplicate listener registration even when themes are refreshed.

### Custom Java2D Charts
All analytics charts are hand-coded using Java2D `Graphics2D`:
- **Line Chart**: Cubic Bezier curves with gradient fills and axis labels.
- **Radar Chart**: Trigonometric polygon with per-category color fills, anti-aliased.
- **Heatmap**: 28-cell `4×7` grid with opacity-mapped daily activity intensities.

### Programmatic Sound Synthesis
`SoundService` generates all audio in real time using PCM sine-wave generation, avoiding any runtime audio file dependency. Tone slides are implemented using frequency interpolation over sample frames.
