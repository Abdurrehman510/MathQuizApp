> **"Transforming arithmetic practice from a chore into a daily adventure — one question at a time."**

<br/>

Atelier Arithmetic is a **production-quality, feature-rich Java Swing desktop application** built for children aged 8–17. It transforms standard arithmetic practice into an engaging, self-directed learning experience through adaptive question generation, a persistent progress system, a real-time per-question timer, a comprehensive answer review screen, and a fully interactive guided onboarding tour narrated by **Archie the Owl** — the app's brand mascot.

This project demonstrates strong product thinking, clean software engineering, modern child-friendly UX design, and genuine educational value — far beyond a typical quiz application.

## Overview & Vision

### The Problem

Most arithmetic quiz applications are **disposable** — you answer questions, see a score, close the app, and remember nothing. They offer no insight into what went wrong, no reason to return tomorrow, and no sense of progress over time. For children in particular, punitive grading language ("BAD", "VERY VERY BAD") actively discourages continued use.

### The Solution

Atelier Arithmetic is positioned not as a quiz app, but as a **personal math training companion**. It:

- Tells children **exactly** which questions they got wrong and what the correct answers were.
- Tracks **how fast** they answered each question, encouraging computational fluency.
- **Saves every session** to a unified relational SQLite database under user profiles to show long-term analytics and streak highlights.
- Uses **encouraging, growth-mindset language** in every piece of feedback.
- Onboards every new user with a **friendly interactive tour** so they immediately feel confident using the full feature set.

The result is an application children *want* to come back to — rather than one that makes them feel judged and want to leave.

| **Under 33%** | D | Keep Trying — Every Step Counts! |

---

## Data Persistence & SQLite Architecture

To ensure enterprise-grade stability, data protection, and profile scaling, the application uses an **embedded relational SQLite database** stored at `~/.atelier-arithmetic/atelier_arithmetic.db`.

```
                  ┌──────────────────────┐
                  │       sessions       │
                  ├──────────────────────┤
                  │ (PK) id (Integer)    │◄──────┐
                  │ profile_name (Text)  │       │
                  │ timestamp (Text)     │       │
                  │ ...                  │       │  Foreign Key
                  └──────────────────────┘       │  (Cascading Delete)
                                                 │
                  ┌──────────────────────┐       │
                  │  session_questions   │       │
                  ├──────────────────────┤       │
                  │ (PK) id (Integer)    │       │
                  │ (FK) session_id (Int)├───────┘
                  │ expression (Text)    │
                  │ ...                  │
                  └──────────────────────┘
```

- **Atomic Transactions**: All session metadata and multiple question results are stored inside a single relational transaction block. If an insertion fails, changes are completely rolled back to maintain integrity.
- **Unified Profile Storage**: Rather than splitting files across profiles, all user records are stored in a single database indexed by a `profile_name` column.
- **Cascading Purges**: Purging history via `repository.clear()` utilizes SQLite's standard foreign-key cascades (`ON DELETE CASCADE`) to clean up database tables cleanly.

## 🔒 Security, Child Safety & Privacy Compliance (COPPA / GDPR-K)

Atelier Arithmetic implements strict privacy-by-design principles to ensure compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (**COPPA**) and **GDPR-K** guidelines for minors:

### 1. Zero PII Data Collection (Data Minimization)
- **Local-First Isolation**: All user profile data, stats, achievements, settings, and learning histories are stored strictly offline locally on the client machine. The application makes zero external network queries, protecting children from data leaks or cloud breaches.
- **COPPA Profile Creation Dialog**: When adding a profile, the user is presented with a privacy directive stating: *"To protect child safety, please do not use your real first or last name!"*
- **Mascot Name Generator**: Children can click the **🎭 Spark Mascot Name** button to generate fun, adjective-animal pseudonym profile names (e.g. *"Calm Dolphin"*, *"Clever Fox"*) without revealing personally identifiable information.

### 2. Secure Local Data Encryption (AES-128)
To prevent local tampering, cheating (unlocking badges or altering score percentages), or unauthorized reading of a child's study records, the application implements AES-128 symmetric encryption:
- **Unique Machine Key Derivation**: Encryption keys are dynamically derived from hardware/OS parameters (`user.name`, `os.name`, `user.home`) processed via a SHA-256 hash. This binds the database to the host machine.
- **Secure SQLite Persistence**: Sensitive fields inside the relational database (profile names, math categories, difficulty ratings, accuracy scores, and custom expression keys) are stored as encrypted Base64 ciphertexts.
- **Secure Preferences**: User options stored inside `config.properties` are fully encrypted.

### 3. Word-Based Math Parental Gates
Administrative controls and data deletion parameters are locked behind a **Parental Gate** to ensure parent/teacher oversight:
- **Math Verification Locks**: Opening the **Quiz Builder**, editing custom lists, or clicking **🗑 Reset History** launches a random text-based arithmetic lock challenge (e.g., *"Parent Verification: What is eight times nine?"* in words). The action proceeds only upon entering the correct mathematical value.

- **Daily seeded Quest**: Earn a massive `100` bonus coins for completing the Daily seeded Challenge.
- **Encrypted Local Ledger**: All coin transactions, unlocked purchases, and equipped configurations are safely compiled and stored locally inside the profile-specific Base64 AES-128 preferences properties.

### 2. Custom Mascot Shop
- **Archie's Accessories**: Children can spend their math coins to buy cool decorations for Archie the Owl:
  *   **Fancy Bow Tie** 🎀 (Cost: `80` coins)
  *   **Cool Glasses** 🕶️ (Cost: `100` coins)
  *   **Wizard Hat** 🧙‍♂️ (Cost: `150` coins)
  *   **Gold Crown** 👑 (Cost: `300` coins)
- **Dynamic Outfit Display**: Equipped accessories are worn by Archie and mentioned dynamically in his speech greetings (e.g. *"I'm wearing my Gold Crown 👑 today!"*).

### 3. Dynamic Visual Themes
Kids can unlock primary UI theme accent colors:
- **Amethyst Theme** 🟣 (Cost: `200` coins) — Recolors active elements to a royal purple layout.
- **Emerald Theme** 🟢 (Cost: `200` coins) — Recolors active elements to a vibrant green layout.
- **Ruby Theme** 🔴 (Cost: `250` coins) — Recolors active elements to a modern red layout.
Themes update the borders, buttons, and graphics of the entire Swing tree recursively in real time.

---

## Immersive Audio System

The application features a modular sound synthesizer engine (`SoundService.java`) which preloads audio files into memory for low-latency triggers:
- **Global Instrumentation**: Using `AppTheme.scaleComponentFont()`, hover and click listeners are dynamically attached to *every JButton* inside the application, giving instant physical feedback.
- **Diverse Sound Cues**: Tone triggers include startup fanfares, clicks, hovers, quiz completions, count-down sound checks, correct/incorrect bells, and badge unlock alerts.
- **Settings Popup**: A custom popup panel on the Welcome screen provides independent volume sliders and mute controls, triggering test tones when adjusted.

---

## Global Exception Handling

Atelier Arithmetic is designed to never freeze or crash silently.
- **JVM Uncaught Interceptor**: A global handler registered via `Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler()` catches all uncaught exceptions in worker thread pools and the main Swing Event Dispatch Thread (EDT).
- **Disk File Logging**: When an exception occurs, a clean stack trace is automatically generated and written to `~/.atelier-arithmetic/logs/error.log`.
- **User Alert Dialog**: Triggers a child-friendly error popup window notifying the user of a safe recovery route, preventing frustrating app freezes.

---

## Design Philosophy

1.  **Vibrant & Accessible Styling**: Employs warm typography (Serif headings, SansSerif body), custom rounded card panels with drop-shadow margins, and contrasting HSL-based palettes (including Dark Mode).
2.  **Growth Mindset**: No punitive text or visual triggers. Replaces typical "game-over" red screens with soft alerts and supportive tips from Archie the Owl.
3.  **Parent & Teacher Empowerment**: Includes an embedded Quiz Builder allowing custom mathematical prompts and answer templates to test classroom objectives.

---

## Technical Highlights

### Base64 Embedded Report Export
The report exporter reads the local brand icon `logo.png` dynamically, converts it to an offline-compatible Base64 data URI, and writes it directly inside the generated HTML report file, ensuring zero broken image icons when shared across machines.
